### Explanation:

* The graph shows a directed graph with six nodes labeled s, t, A, B, C, and capacities on the edges.
* The first iteration shows the original graph with the flow from s to t as 0.
* The algorithm starts by finding an augmenting path from s to t.
* The second iteration shows the result of augmenting the flow along the path with a flow of 1.
* The algorithm continues to search for augmenting paths and update the flow until no more paths can be found.
* The final flow is the sum of all the flows along the augmenting paths found during the algorithm.
