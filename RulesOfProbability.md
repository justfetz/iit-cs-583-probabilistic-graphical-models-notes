## Some Rules Of Probability

**Bayes' rule:** Bayes' rule is a fundamental rule of probability that describes how to update probabilities based on new evidence. It states that the probability of a hypothesis given the data is proportional to the product of the prior probability of the hypothesis and the likelihood of the data given the hypothesis, divided by the marginal probability of the data. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
P(H | D) = P(D | H) * P(H) / P(D)

where H is a hypothesis, D is the observed data, P(H) is the prior probability of H, P(D | H) is the likelihood of the data given H, and P(D) is the marginal probability of the data.

**Law of total probability:** The law of total probability states that the probability of an event can be calculated by summing the probabilities of all possible ways the event can occur, weighted by their respective probabilities. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
P(A) = âˆ‘ P(A | B) * P(B)

where A and B are events, and the sum is taken over all possible values of B.

**Conditional probability:** Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. It is calculated by dividing the joint probability of the two events by the probability of the conditioning event. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
P(A | B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

where A and B are events.

**Independence:** Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

where A and B are independent events.
